        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>Unfold the board. Split the green team from the brown team and equally split item cards. Shuffle brown cards with the items, and green cards with the other half of the items. Give the green team player the green deck, and give the brown team player the brown deck. Put both decks faced own, and each player draws 3 cards. Each player gets 11 pawns, and surrounds each base with the pawns. The game is ready to begin.</p>
